Files Fusion
============

When dealing with simulations, it is a good approach to save the results of
different simulations on different files, in order to be easy to run the simulation across
different computers. However, eventually, fusion of the different
simulations is needed. The aim of this repository is to create scripts and
to keep track of ideas on this direction.
